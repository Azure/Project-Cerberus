/**
 * An X.509 handler that only supports building certificates.  This support is provided without
 * requiring any external ASN.1 encoders.  The primary use-case for this would be for DICE layer 0
 * code to build the DICE identity certificate chain.
 *
 * This implementation does not provide any functionality for certificate parsing and authentication
 * and must not be used in any contexts that have X509_ENABLE_AUTHENTICATION defined.
 *
 * This implementation only provides ASN.1/DER encoding for certificate and CSR building.  All
 * crypto functionality is leveraged through the common crypto APIs.  This allows any hardware or
 * software crypto implementation to be used for certificate signing.
 *
 * There is only limited support for RSA keys with this implementation to allow signing certificates
 * containing an RSA public key.
 *   - Input RSA keys are required to be public keys.
 *   - RSA CSRs or self-signed certificates cannot be created.
 *   - Certificate signing using an RSA CA is not supported.
