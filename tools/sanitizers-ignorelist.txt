[alignment]
# heap_with_defrag_* functions align structures to 4 bytes 
# instead of platform alignment, so remove them from sanitizing,
# at least for now
fun:heap_with_defrag_*

# these functions rely on the UB on platforms where 
# unaligned access is supported. Probably needs to be fixed 
# separately
fun:buffer_unaligned_copy*

[null]
# most of the *_static_init_null tests are doing NULL pointer
# derefernces in the test setup code, but it is not problem for 
# run time, so exclude them
fun:*_static_init_null

[function]
# these functions do call observable functions through
# void(void*) or void(void*,void*) pointer, by design
fun:observable_notify_observers
fun:observable_notify_observers_with_ptr

# these tests call observer functions directly through the
# incorrect type, utilizing UB for observer optimization.
